Stack is an area of memory that holds all local variables and parameters used by any function and remembers the order in which functions are called so that function returns occur correctly. ‘push’ operation is used to add an element to stack and ‘pop’ operation is used to remove an element from stack. ‘peek’ operation is also implemented returning the value of the top element without removing it. The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure.
For converting decimal number to binary, initially we push all the binary digits formed into the stack. After the entire number has been converted into the binary form, we pop one digit at a time from the stack and print it. Therefore we get the decimal number converted into its proper binary form.
