This is a Java Program to implement Heap. A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: If A is a parent node of B then key(A) is ordered with respect to key(B) with the same ordering applying across the heap. Either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node (max heap) or the keys of parent nodes are less than or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node (min heap). Heaps are crucial in several efficient graph algorithms such as Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and in the sorting algorithm heapsort.
