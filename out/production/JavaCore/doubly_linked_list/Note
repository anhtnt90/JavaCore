This is a Java Program to implement a Doubly Linked List. A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of a data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence. In a doubly linked list each node has two links one pointing to the next node in the list and one pointing to the previous node in the list .
