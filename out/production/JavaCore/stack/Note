Stack is an area of memory that holds all local variables and parameters used by any function and remembers the order in which functions are called so that function returns occur correctly. ‘push’ operation is used to add an element to stack and ‘pop’ operation is used to remove an element from stack. ‘peek’ operation is also implemented returning the value of the top element without removing it. The relation between the push and pop operations is such that the stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. The implemented stack has bounded capacity.
